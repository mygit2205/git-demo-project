# Git Demo Project

This is a beginner-level Git and GitHub project created to understand version control, repository management, and live website hosting using GitHub Pages.

## ✅ What I Did
- Created a GitHub repository named `git-demo-project`
- Cloned the repository to my local system using Git Bash
- Created and added files like `hello.txt` and `index.html`
- Used Git commands: `add`, `commit`, and `push` to send files to GitHub
- Enabled GitHub Pages to host the HTML file as a live website
